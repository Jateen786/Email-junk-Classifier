**Email Junk Classifier üìßüõ°Ô∏è**
This project is an intelligent email classifier that helps filter out spam and categorize emails as either "junk" or "legitimate." By analyzing key features of email content, metadata, and sender information, the classifier improves the accuracy of email filtering, providing a robust solution for managing email inboxes.

**Features**
Spam Classification: Detects and classifies spam emails based on extracted features such as subject, content, and sender reputation.
Blacklist and Whitelist Management: Maintains dynamic blacklists for known spammers and whitelists for trusted senders.
Customizable: Offers flexibility to fine-tune filtering parameters to meet user-specific needs and improve classification accuracy.

**Tech Stack**
Python (scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK)
Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM)
Email data preprocessing and feature extraction

**How It Works**
Extracts features from email content (subject, body, sender, etc.).
Applies machine learning models to classify emails as "junk" or "legitimate."
Updates and uses blacklist/whitelist to refine classification decisions.

**Installation & Usage**
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies using requirements.txt.
Run the classifier on your email dataset to categorize emails.
